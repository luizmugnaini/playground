# Sale database management through a REPL

The script `sales.py` implements a REPL that can be used to create databases, add and remove items,
save database to csv file, and some other functionalities. This script was developed as a solution
to a simple problem of creating a sale database that I decided overcomplicate and have some fun in
the process.
