Solutions to coding-interview problems

Here I store solutions to interview-like coding problems, my solutions will be sometimes in C and
others in C++. The coding style will be quite corporate and boring, if a solution is in C++, then
STL will almost surely be used. This goes against all of my programming principles and doesn't
reflect the way I actually program C++ (if you want to see something that I really care about being
good and having great performance, see the Presheaf library https://github.com/luizmugnaini/presheaf).

Why do I do this? Well because I need to pay the bills and eat --- therefore the solutions are
written *for* the interviewers in mind, which will commonly want to know if I'm aware of the new
shiny slow and bloated Modernâ„¢ C++ bullshit.

The C-based solutions will most certainly be more in line with my like of thinking and the way I
naturally program. If you're not brainwashed by corporate programming, please refer to those for the
real non-stupid solutions.
