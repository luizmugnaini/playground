Solutions to coding-interview problems

Here I store solutions to interview-like coding problems, my solutions will be sometimes in C and
others in C++. The coding style will be quite corporate, if a solution is in C++, then STL will
almost surely be used. This goes against all of my programming principles and doesn't reflect the
way I actually program C++ (if you want to see something that I really care about being good and
having great performance, see the Presheaf library https://github.com/luizmugnaini/presheaf).
